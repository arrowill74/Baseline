# RecVAE
The official PyTorch implementation of the paper "RecVAE: A New Variational Autoencoder for Top-N Recommendations with Implicit Feedback".

This is a preliminary version, but sufficient to reproduce the results. Code will be refactored soon!

Some sources from  [Variational autoencoders for collaborative filtering](https://github.com/dawenl/vae_cf) is partially used. Use preprocessing script from that repository before running RecVAE notebook.
